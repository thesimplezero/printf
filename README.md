The **parser()** function takes a format string, a list of conversion functions, and a list of arguments. It identifies conversion specifiers in the format string, calling the appropriate function to print the corresponding argument. If a specifier is not recognized, it prints the character following the % symbol.
Concepts: format strings, conversion specifiers, function calls, string manipulation, control flow.

The **print_char()** function takes a character as an argument and prints it to standard output.
Concepts: character data type, standard output, function calls.

The **print_string()** function takes a string as an argument and prints it to standard output.
Concepts: string data type, standard output, function calls.

The **print_percent()** function prints a percent symbol to standard output.
Concepts: character data type, standard output, function calls.

The **print_integer()** function takes an integer as an argument and prints it to standard output.
Concepts: integer data type, standard output, function calls.

The **unsigned_integer()** function takes an unsigned integer as an argument and prints it to standard output.
Concepts: unsigned integer data type, standard output, function calls.

The **print_binary()** function takes an unsigned integer as an argument, converts it to binary, and prints it to standard output.
Concepts: binary number system, unsigned integer data type, standard output, function calls.

The **print_octal()** function takes an unsigned integer as an argument, converts it to octal, and prints it to standard output.
Concepts: octal number system, unsigned integer data type, standard output, function calls.

The **print_hex()** function takes an unsigned integer as an argument, converts it to hexadecimal in lowercase, and prints it to standard output.
Concepts: hexadecimal number system, unsigned integer data type, standard output, function calls.
